SignSight
=========
SignSight is an open source solution for automatic traffic sign recognition in cars. It will accomplish this using camera hardware to capture images of traffic signs and use software to recognize traffic signs in the image and extract useful information from the image. SignSight could, for example, be used to display the current speed limit to the driver.
